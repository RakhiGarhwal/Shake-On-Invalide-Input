# Shake-On-Invalide-Input

ðŸš€ Excited to share my first solo project! ðŸš€

I built a simple yet interactive feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€” "Shake on Invalid Value."

If the user tries to submit without entering anything, the field shakes and shows an "Invalid Input" message. But if they enter any value, it confirms with a "Valid Input" message. A small but effective way to enhance user experience!

This was a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m excited to build more! Let me know your thoughts. ðŸ˜Š
